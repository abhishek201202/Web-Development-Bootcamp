	<h2> <a href="https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/45223"> SOS DP</a></h2>
	<p>In this post, I am going to share <span>my little knowledge</span> on how to solve some problems involving calculation of <i>Sum over Subsets</i>(SOS) using <b>dynamic programming</b>. Thus the name <strong>SOS DP</strong>. I have chosen this topic because it appears frequently in contests as mediu2m-hard and above problems but has very few blogs/editorials explaining the interesting DP behind it. I also have a predilection for this since I came across it for the first time in ICPC <em>Amritapuri Regionals</em> 2014. Since then I have created many questions based on this concept on various platforms but the number of accepted solutions always seems to be disproportionate to the lucidity of the concept. Following is a small attempt to bridge this gap. </p>

<p>I will be addressing the following problem: Given a fixed array A of 2N integers, we need to calculate âˆ€ x function F(x) = Sum of all A[i] such that x&i = i, i.e., i is a subset of x.</p>
